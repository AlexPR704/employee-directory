## Description

Created with React, this employee directory is a fast and easy way to display non-confidential information about employees for managers or co-workers. Employees can be searched for by name and the directory can be sorted by alphabetical order so team members can be found more easily.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## How to Run

To run this app locally, be sure to npm install first.

Open the root directory in your desired terminal and run npm start to launch the app.
