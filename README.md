## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Description

Created with React, this employee directory is a fast and easy way to display non-confidential information about employees for managers or co-workers. Employees can be searched for by name and the directory can be sorted by alphabetical order so team members can be found more easily.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## How to Run
